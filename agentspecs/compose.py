"""Composing and extending specs: `extends` and `includes`.

Four specs that share a sandbox variant, a toolset and a set of conventions
should not drift apart by hand, so a spec can say what it builds on:

    extends: loop-base:0.0.1        # inheritance — "the same agent, adjusted"
    includes: [notebook-surfaces]   # composition — "this bundle, wherever needed"

A **fragment** is not a runnable agent: no model, no system prompt, only
capability. That distinction is what avoids a recursion trap — if the notebook
specialists inherited from the base agent they would inherit its subagent list,
and `@NotebookCompactor` could delegate to itself. Shared capability goes in a
fragment; only the base declares subagents.

Resolution happens when a catalogue is generated, so what is generated stays
flat, a runtime keeps no inheritance logic, and the result of a merge is
visible in a diff. The rules are documented under `docs/modularity`.

This is the mechanism a Cog uses to extend an agent (`agentspecs.cogs`). It
lived only in agent-runtimes' code generation before agentspecs 0.0.12; it is
here so that the package that documents the rules also applies them.
