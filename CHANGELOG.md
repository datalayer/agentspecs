# Changelog

## 0.0.10

- Model providers: one spec per provider under `agentspecs/model-providers/` (Anthropic,
  Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Alibaba Cloud Model Studio, Cloudflare, Ollama) —
  its site, its documentation, its terms of service, its privacy policy, what it says
  about the data a request carries, and whether it runs the model or the user's machine
  does. `agentspecs.model_providers`; a model naming a provider with no spec is refused.
- Models: `provider_url`, the page on the provider's site that describes the model, on
  every spec.

## 0.0.9

- Models: Jev, Typesafe's typed-judgment model, in the catalogue once per Cloudflare route —
  `cloudflare:gtw/typesafe/jev` and `cloudflare:wrk/typesafe/jev` — with the
  capability `judgments`; `gpt-oss-120b` and Claude Sonnet 4.6 carry `judge`, a chat model
  that may be asked the same questions.
- Models: `route` (`workers-ai` or `ai-gateway`) says which Cloudflare product a model is
  reached through; `context_window`, `zero_data_retention` and `pricing` (dollars per
  million tokens) are typed fields a service can meter and choose by. The capability
  vocabulary and the routes are checked when the catalogue loads.
- The Cloudflare ids and spec files carry the flavour: `cloudflare:wrk/<vendor>/<model>`
  in `cloudflare-wrk-*.yaml` (Workers AI) and `cloudflare:gtw/<vendor>/<model>` in
  `cloudflare-gtw-*.yaml` (AI Gateway). The six chat models were `cloudflare:<vendor>/<model>`;
  datalayer-ai-inference still accepts that spelling as the Workers AI flavour.

## 0.0.8

- Models: Cloudflare Workers AI as a provider — six models (`gpt-oss-120b`, Llama 3.3 70B,
  Qwen3.8 27B, Gemma 4 26B, GLM-5.2, Kimi K2.6), asked for as `cloudflare:<vendor>/<model>`
  and hosted through datalayer-ai-inference; the docs page says how they are billed.
- An id with a vendor segment (`cloudflare:wrk/openai/gpt-oss-120b`) gets an enum name of its own
  (`CLOUDFLARE_OPENAI_GPT_OSS_120B`): the slash is replaced like the colon.
