# Changelog

## 0.0.8

- Models: Cloudflare Workers AI as a provider — six models (`gpt-oss-120b`, Llama 3.3 70B,
  Qwen3.8 27B, Gemma 4 26B, GLM-5.2, Kimi K2.6), asked for as `cloudflare:<vendor>/<model>`
  and hosted through datalayer-ai-inference; the docs page says how they are billed.
- An id with a vendor segment (`cloudflare:openai/gpt-oss-120b`) gets an enum name of its own
  (`CLOUDFLARE_OPENAI_GPT_OSS_120B`): the slash is replaced like the colon.
